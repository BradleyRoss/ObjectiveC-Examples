<h1>CoreMIDI, BRossTools, and Related Items</h1>
<h2>BRossTools</h2>
<p>The project BRossTools is part of the GitHub repository 
   <a href="https://github.com/BradleyRoss/ObjectiveC-Examples" target="_blank">BradleyRoss/ObjectiveC-Examples</a>
   and keeps a number of samples of Objective-C code.  The Doxygen documentation for this project can be found
   <a href="BRossTools/html/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>When the BRossTools.app executable is run, it displays a menu whose options are listed below.  There are in the
   order they appear in the window together with the caption for each menu item.  The item before the caption
   is the internal code for the menu item.  After the caption, some of the classes, methods, and functions
   that are used in the case are listed.  The code for creating the button and their actions can be found
   in the class mainMenu.</p>
<ul>
<li>m3:"Listen for keystrokes using CoreMIDI Ver 2 (original version)" The system listens to the
    first source returned by MIDIGetNumberOfSources, presumably a MIDI keyboard.</li>
<li>m4:"Kill CoreMIDI Client (ver 2)" -- This halts the MIDI client software that was started with
    button m3 and the software will no longer listen for keystrokes.</li>
<li>m5:"Read a dummy MIDIPacketList" After creating the dummy list, it then parses it.</li>
<li>m6:"Send a dummy MIDIPacketList" The client sends the contents of the list to the first
    destination returned by MIDIGetNumberOfDestinations.  This should be some form of MIDI
    synthesizer.</li>
<li>b5:"CoreMIDI - Show configuration"  A list is displayed of the MIDI devices, entities, and
    endpoints together with their endpoints.</li>
<li>b6:"CoreMIDI - Show sources/destinations" List MIDI sources and destinations.  This list may
    differ from the soures and destinations shown by button b5.</li>
<li>b1:"This will trigger the e2 test which opens a window, colors it, and inserts 
    a few text fields and buttons.</li>
<li>b2:"Run test1 new window plus fields"</li>
<li>b3:"Run  test2 text handling window"</li>
<li>b4:"Run test3"</li>
<li>b7:"Run test5 - CFDictionary, CFArray, etc."</li>
<li>b8:"Run test4 - Playing with pointers"</li>
</ul>
<h2>CoreMIDI</h2>
<p>I ran the C header file for the CoreMIDI framework through Doxygen and posted the results
    <a href="CoreMidi/html/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  I have been comparing the information with the
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremidi?language=objc" target="_blank">
    Developer Documentation for Core MIDI</a>.  This needs to be examined further.  
    <a href="CoreMIDI.html" target="_blank">An annotated list
    of some of the CoreMIDI data structures can be found here</a>.</p>


<!-- GetMacOSStatusCommentString  GetMacOSStatusErrorString are deprecarted and it is unclear if they still exist. -->

<h2>CoreMIDI Examples from Internet</h2>
<p>I have been searching the internet for examples of Objective-C code using the CoreMIDI library. Unfortunately,
   I have had a problem finding examples newer that ten years old.  It appears that many of these
   examples use API's that are deprecated and it appears that I will have to review all of the samples that I
   find.</p>
