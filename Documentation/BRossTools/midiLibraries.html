<h1>MIDI Software Libraries</h1>
<p>This is the start of a document discussing a number of software libraries that can be used to
   create MIDI software.  It will be enlarged as I get more information.  Except for my own software,
   I can't really comment on the software quality or current state of maintenance.  However, I will try to flesh
   these out as I get more information.</p>

<h2>Multi-platform</h2>

<h2>Java</h2>

<h2>Apple MacOS</h2>

<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremidi?language="objc" target="_blank">
    Apple CoreMIDI Documentation</a> The amount of documentation available for MIDI 2.0 modules is 
    extremely limited, but I am hopeful that the information in  <a href="https://imitone.com/discover-midi/" target="_blank">
    https://imitone.com/discover-midi/</a> is proving very useful in understanding the Apple documentation.</li>
<li><a href="http://donyaquick.com/working-with-midi-on-mac-os-x/" target="_blank">
    Working with MIDI on Mac (OS X)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mixedinkey-opensource/MIKMIDI" target="_blank">
    mixedinkey-opensource/MIKMIDI, GitHub project</a> It's not clear to what extent this represents the current code base.  However,
    it appears that it is worth looking at.  <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/MIKMIDI/1.6.1/" target="_blank">
    More documentation can be found here.  From what I can see, work is proceeding on adapting the software to ARM64 architecture,
    but I'm not sure of the status of this work.</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/bradleyross/ObjectiveC-Examples" target="_blank">The BRossTools Xcode project in the GitHub
    repository bradleyross/ObjectiveC-Examples</a> contains a few attempt to write software using the Apple Core MIDI framework.
    Some of the demonstrations in this package are updated versions of some other examples that I found in the literature.  This
    is very definitely a work in process, but some of the code may be useful to programmers.</li>
