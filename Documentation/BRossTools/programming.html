<h1>MIDI Programming</h1>

<p>The purpose of this document is to provide information on the software programming environments for MIDI
   software.  This page is a summary, and there will be links to more detailed information.

<p><a href="index.html" target="BRossTools">Return to main page for the BRossTools project.</a></p>

<h2>Apple Systems</h2>
<p>The bulk of the programming effort for Apple Operating Systems
   (macOS, tvOS, iOS, watchOS) is done using Xcode. The software can be downloaded for
   free and the resulting code is freely redistributable, but XCode is not freely 
   redistributable.  (The normal license requires a separate copy to be downloaded for each programmer.)</p> 
<p>The following are some of the relevant pages that I have found on the Apple website.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/audio/" target="_blank">Working with Audio</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have not been able to find example programs for MIDI on Apple's website, and most of the pages that I have 
   seen on other websites are several years old and need a lot of updating.  I have some example programs in
   the <a href="https://github.com/bradleyross/ObjectiveC-Examples" target="_blank">BRossTools project in
   the bradleyross/ObjectiveC-Examples repository on GitHub</a>,
   <a href="https://bradleyross.github.io/ObjectiveC-Examples/Documentation/BRossTools/" target="_blank">with
   a documentation page on GitHub.</a></li>

<h2>Java</h2>
<p>The Java SDK (Software Development Kit) can be downloaded for free from 
   Oracle's website.  Although it contains a compiler and other utilities, most people use 
   an IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans to develop Java software.</p>
<p>The following is some documentation for MIDI using Java.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="" target="_blank">The Java&trade; Tutorials - Overview of the MIDI package, Oracle </a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following are some attempts to provide links between Java and the CoreMIDI framework in macOS.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J" target="_blank">CoreMidi4j</a>  This uses Java to access
   the CoreMIDI frameworkin a JNI (Java Native Interface)</li>

<!--  <li><a href=http://www.xfactory-librarians.co.uk/java.html" target="_blank">
    xfactory Java Runtime Environment</a></li> -->

<li><a href="https://github.com/locurasoft/osxmidi4j" target=_blank">osxmidi4j</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I had some examples of Java code but they were from years ago and it looks like they will need
   to revised..</p>

<h2>UNIX</h2>
<p>UNIX is available as a set of individual distributions, with each distribution normally obtained from a different
   source, although some sources may support multiple distributions.  UNIX is designed for source code compatibility
   rather than the interchangability of executable code.<p>
<p>I have found a list of <a href="http://linux-sound.org/one-page.html#midi" target="_blank">Sound and MIDI software for Linux</a>,
   I am not sure how they can be combined into a unified system.  The problem is that the backbone of the MIDI system
   is not defined as part of the Linux standard.  However, there appears to be an ALSA specification for a MIDI server.
   If ALSA really is the standard, it will make things somewhat easier.</p>

<li><a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/MIDI-HOWTO.html" target+"_blank">  The Linux MIDI-HOWTO</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have very little experience with MIDI on Linus or other flavors of UNIX.  If you want to work in this
   area, you will have to find somebody a lot more familiar with the subject than myself.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>The most commonly used IDE for Microsoft operating systems is Visual Studio.  There is a free version, 
   Microsoft Virtual Studio 1999, Community Edition.  There are few limitations for development of Open Source 
   software or by organizations with under 250 employees.  However. some component libraries may have
   a separate fee.</p>
<p>Microsoft has some samples of MIDI programs.</p>
