<h1>Objective-C Examples</h1>
<p>This includes a number of Objective-C Xcode projects.  The
   Git repository is located at 
   <a href="https://www.github.com/BradleyRoss/ObjectiveC-Examples" target="_blank">

<h2>BRossTools</h2>
<p>This package displays some menus and allows the selection of a number of demonstration
   pieces of code.  At this time, it is not fully functional on ARM architectures because of
   problems with the MIKMIDI framework.  <a href="BRossTools/BRossTools/html/index.html" target="_blank">The 
   Doxygen documentation is located here.</a></p>
<h2>HelloWorld</h2>
<p>The classic HelloWorld example from the XCode samples.</p>

<h2>MIDIConstantStudy</h2>
<p>This illustrates the nature of a number of constants involved in selecting MIDI properties.
   It also illustrates some string operations.</p>
<h1>Deprecated projects</h1>
<p>These are some projects that are no longer supported because of problems with the code.  The functionality
   has been moved to the <a href="BRossTools/BRossTools/html/" target="_blank">BRossTools project.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>CoreMidiDemo</br />
   This is the first example from
   <a href="http://xmidi.com/how-to-access-midi-devices-with-coremidi/" target="_blank">
   http://xmidi.com/how-to-access-midi-devices-with-coremidi/</a> and shows an example of 
   getting a list of MIDI devices from the MIDI server on OS X.  Please note that this
   software tracks all devices that have ever been attached, so it may include several
   units that are not currently in use.</li>
<li>CoreMidiDemo2</br />
   This is the second example from the article <i>How to Access MIDI Devices with CoreMidi</i>.
   This example uses a different API and only lists devices that are currently connected.  It should 
   be noted that this program requires over three seconds to run.  However, this appears to be mainly due 
   to the time spent loading the dynamically linked libraries.</li>
<li>XMidiSample1<br />
   This is a modified version of CoreMidiDemo that has been stored as a project inside a
   workspace.</li>
<li>XMidiSample2<br />
   This is a modified version of CoreMidiDemo2 that has been stored as a project inside a
   workspace.</li>
<li>CoreMidiSample1<br />
   This is an Objective-C program that I wrote to examine many of the components of the
   Apple CoreMidi framework.  It is stored as a project inside the workspace.  In addition to 
   demonstrating the CoreMidi methods, it also demonstrates the use of return codes
   to indicate anomalous completion and how to traverse a CFDictionary structure.</li>
