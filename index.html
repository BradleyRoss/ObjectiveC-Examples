<h1>Objective-C Examples</h1>
<p>This includes a number of Objective-C Xcode projects.  The
   Git repository is located at 
   <a href="https://www.github.com/BradleyRoss/ObjectiveC-Examples" target="_blank">
   https://www.github.com/BradleyRoss/ObjectiveC-Examples</a> while this page

<h2>CoreMidiDemo</h2>
<p>This is the first example from
   <a href="http://xmidi.com/how-to-access-midi-devices-with-coremidi/" target="_blank">
   http://xmidi.com/how-to-access-midi-devices-with-coremidi/</a> and shows an example of 
   getting a list of MIDI devices from the MIDI server on OS X.  Please note that this
   software tracks all devices that have ever been attached, so it may include several
   units that are not currently in use.</p>
<h2>CoreMidiDemo2</h2>
<p>This is the second example from the article <i>How to Access MIDI Devices with CoreMidi</i>.
   This example uses a different API and only lists devices that are currently connected.  It should 
   be noted that this program requires over three seconds to run.  When accessing the data from another
   program, this means that there may be periods of five seconds or more where the data may be 
   invalid.</p>
